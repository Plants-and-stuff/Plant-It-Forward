#MVP 

-As a user 
  - I would like to land on the homepage and see the navbar
  - I would live to see the details for each plant available 
  - I would like to be able to see when items are available or not
  - I would like to be able to search for desired plants
  - I would like the ability to filter available products 
  - I would like to be able to add a plant to share 
  - I would like to be able to update a plant that I have shared 
  - I would like to be able to delete a plant I have shared 
  
 #Stretch Goals 
 
 -As a user 
  - I would like to be able to customize my plant purchase by size 
  - I should be able to pay for shipping on any plant 
  - I would like the ability to order a heat-pack to protect my plant 
  - I would like to be able to "order" a plant from another user 
  - I would like to see what I previously received in trade 
  - I would like to see what I gave in trades 
  - I would like to be able to order plant insurance (insurance cost 10% of plant value)
  - I would like to leave reviews of plant exchanges (both sides leave an interaction review giving each a rating for future traders)
  - I should be able to see the location where the plant share is available
